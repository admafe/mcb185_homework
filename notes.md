MCB 185 Notes
====================

generally alphabetize. example: alphabetize nucleotides

nucleotides should be lowercase, generally all variable lowercase
amino acids can be uppercase letters

use ifs when events are independent 
use elifs when events are reliant on prior if statements

Write problems/ issues out first, then do the work
Weed out problems/ potential errors (like when you want positives or things)
then you can solve 

**test functions with small check-able values, then expand range once it works**

**use """ not ''' to comment stuff out**

**write a line, then run it; test and retest each line before adding new things**
**Debug each line before writing new lines**
