MCB 185 Notes
====================

generally alphabetize. example: alphabetize nucleotides

nucleotides should be lowercase, generally all variable lowercase
amino acids can be uppercase letters

use ifs when events are independent 
use elifs when events are reliant on prior if statements

Write problems/ issues out first, then do the work
Weed out problems/ potential errors (like when you want positives or things)
then you can solve 

# While loop
while < condition is True/False >
	output/ function here
	
# Questions
- complex numbers in python? how? # don't need to account for them, we don't use em ever
- what output wanted for hydropathy non aa values? zero?, do we want calculations for 
	non aa values?
- for matrix questions, how to get output to take 4x4 format,
	returning in lines but want 4 rows
